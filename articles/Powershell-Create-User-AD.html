        <h4>Summary:</h4>
        <p>
          Creating users in Active Directory is a very common task, but can be very tedious to do manually.
          This led me to create this Object Oriented script which also supports parameters. This same object
          will be used in other AD posts to allow readers to add them together easily into one script. Just
          adjust properties to your environment requirements. Cmdlet used will be New-ADUser.
        </p>
        <p>To skip to the full script click <a href="#full-code">here</a> </p><br>

        <h4>Cmdlet:</h4>
        <p>
          New-AdUser <br>
          This cmdlet will be used to create a user in active directory. Supports the option to set the needed properties<br>
          More info can be found on Microsoft's website: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/addsadministration/new-aduser?view=win10-ps">
            https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/addsadministration/new-aduser?view=win10-ps
          </a>
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Details:</h4>
        <p>
          Parameters are first set to declare the main variables that we are going to be using. I'm a big
          fan of using Parameter in scripts, so I include them as often as possible. For creation of an
          account we will need the following inputs from the user: first/last name, and the group.
          The script will find the distinguished name of the group, the domain its in, and generate
          the username on its own.
        </p>
        <pre><code>
  [CmdletBinding()]Param (

      $first = "",
      $last = "",
      $userName = "",
      $group = ""

  )
            </code></pre>

        <p>
          Import-module activedirectory is required to use Active Directory in powershell. FYI this can be
          added in server manager >add feature > ad module for powershell.
          To allow the script to be run in different domains without modification, ‘longdomain’ finds
          the current domain and ‘shortdomain’ takes off the ‘.com’ at the end. If your domain
          doesn’t end in ‘.com’ then no worries, 'shortdomain' will just be set to the full domain.
          <br><br>
          here we also introduce the creation of the object we will be using of ‘employee’
          and call it $userobj outside of the class. <br>
          modify $password to whichever is the default password in your organization.
          the script sets the account to change at next logon.
        </p>
        <pre><code>
   Import-Module ActiveDirectory
   $GLOBAL:longDomain = [System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectory.Domain]::GetCurrentDomain()
   $GLOBAL:shortDomain = ($longDomain -replace '.com','')
   $userObj = [Employee]::New()
   $password = "TopSecret123!"

          </code></pre>
        <p>
          In ‘ouList’ list, replace the string values with your own OU’s, the numbers aren’t necessary
          But some people find them easier to use than having to type out the whole name.
          Now we can ask the user for which group they want to add the user to. This will only
          be displayed if ‘group’ hasn’t been given as a param with the ‘if(!$group)’ statement.
          This is essentially saying if the group variable is null or empty perform this action.
          <br><br>
          ‘ckey’ gets the value from the array that matches what the user inputs. This helps
          validate if the entry was properly spelled to reduce errors during account creation.
        </p>
        <pre><code>
  #list of OUs in Active Directory
  $ouList = ("1 - Sales","2 - HR", "3 - IT", "4 - Accounting")

  Write-Output "Domain is set to: $longDomain"

  #get the OU if it wasn't given as a Parameter
  if (!$group){

     Write-Output "`nListing groups :" $ouList
     $group = Read-Host "`nEnter the OU for the user "
     }

  #grab the proper OU thats found in 'ouList'
  $ckey =""
  $ckey = $ouList | Where {$_ -match $group}
          </code></pre>

        <p>
          Let’s do a verification check to make sure ‘ckey’ is not actually empty. And if it is, then ask
          for the user to re-enter the value until ‘ckey’ has a value inside. To do this we’ll put it in a
          while loop with the condition of ‘!$ckey’ and as mentioned before this is saying to
          keep looping while value is null or empty.<br><br>
          As you might have noticed, ckey will have the array entry including the number, so we
          need to cut that off the first 4 characters like ‘1 - ‘ and just get the name. IMPORTANT:
          If you did not include numbers in your ‘ouList’ array then remove the substring command.
        </p>

        <pre><code>
  #have user renter OU if entry wasn't found in "ouList"
  while(!$ckey){
      $group = Read-Host "Entry did not match an OU. Re-Enter the OU"
      $ckey = $ouList | Where {$_ -match $group}
  }

  #cut off the numbers ex, '1 - Sales' will just be 'Sales'
  $ckey = $ckey.Substring(4)
  Write-Output "The chosen group is "$ckey
          </code></pre>

        <p>
          Nothing too fancy here, just ask for the first and last name if it wasn't
          given as a Parameter.
        </p>

        <pre><code>
  #get first and last name if not provided as Param
  if(!$first){
      $first = Read-Host "`nEnter the FIRST name " }

  if(!$last){
      $last = Read-Host "Enter the LAST name " }
          </code></pre>

        <p>
          Now that we have all the values we need from the user, lets pass them
          to our object Employee. We will see these varibles in a little when
          we declare them in the actual object.
        </p>

        <pre><code>
  #Pass values to object
  $userObj.lastName = $last
  $userObj.firstName = $first
  $userObj.userGroup = $ckey
  $userObj.userPass = $password
          </code></pre>

        <p>
          The benefit of creating classes is we can create methods to do all the dirty work which
          allows the main code to look cleaner. So the first method we would like to do is create a
          generate a username/Sam account Name for when we create the account. Let’s name
          it ‘GetSamName’ and only call it if a username wasn’t given as a Parameter.

        </p>

        <pre><code>
  #generate username if not given from Param
  if(!$userName){
      $userObj.GetSamName()}
  else{
      $userObj.SamName = $userName }

  Write-Output "Username will be " $userObj.SamName
          </code></pre>

        <p>
          For the last part of the main script, before we get to the object, we will call the method
          to create the account then clear the variables. This is helpful because sometimes they stay
          in cache and can cause problems if you run the script again since there’s alot of logic that
          says do such and such if the variable is empty<br><br>
          Instead of just calling the method I want to put it in a try/catch statement which are great
          for error handling. If successful then it will print the ‘success’ output and perform a
          Get-Aduser on the new account to print out its details. If there’s an error then it will
          display the ‘fail’ message and give the error

        </p>

        <pre><code>
  try{
    $userObj.CreateAccount()
    Write-Output "SUCCESS: Account was created. Outputing Account info below:"
    Get-ADUser $userObj.SamName
  }
  catch{
    Write-Host "FAIL: account did not get created due to error below:" -ForegroundColor Red
    $_
  }

  clear-variable -Name last,first,password,group,username
          </code></pre>

        <p>
          Finally welcome to the object of Employee, here we will set the properties
          and methods. Throughout the object I will refer to this variables with variables
          of '$this'
        </p>
        <pre><code>
  class Employee{
    [string]$lastName
    [string]$firstName
    [string]$userGroup
    [string]$SamName
    [string]$userPass
          </code></pre>

        <p>
          Here is our first of two methods ‘GetSamName’ and set as a ‘void’ since we won’t be
          returning any variable back to the main script. This snippet is where will be modified
          to however your organization sets the username. Here it takes the first name initial, period,
          first 6 characters of last name, and a number. So mine would be ,j.villar1'.
        </p>

        <pre><code>
  [void]GetSamName(){

    if($this.lastName.Length -le 6){
        $length = $this.lastName.Length}
    else{
        $length = 6 }

    #generate next username available
    $start = $this.firstName[0] + "."
    $mid = $this.lastName.Substring(0,$length)
    $end = 1
    [string]$fullSam = $start + $mid + $end
          </code></pre>

        <p>
          While the username that we generate is taken then add ‘1’ to the end and check again. Repeat
          until a username is not already taken. Then pass this back to the class property of ‘SamName’
        </p>

        <pre><code>
  #check Sam Account Name isn't take, if it is then add '1'
  while(([ADSISearcher] "SamAccountName=$fullSam").FindOne()){
      $end += 1
      [string]$fullSam = $start + $mid + $end
  }
  $this.SamName = $fullSam

  }
          </code></pre>

        <p>
          At last we finally get to the method to actually create the account. ‘CreateAccount’ is also
          Set as a ‘void’ since we aren’t returning any variables to the main script. It uses all the
          Objects set properties and find the distinguished path to the group that user picked.
          ‘New-AdUser’ sets all the values which again can be customized to however your
          Organization sets it. Then adds user to be group member with ‘Add-ADGroupMember’
        </p>

        <pre><code>
  [void]CreateAccount(){
    #get group path
    $dPath = Get-ADOrganizationalUnit -Filter 'Name -eq $this.userGroup' |
             Select Name,DistinguishedName

    New-ADUser -SamAccountName $this.SamName `
       -GivenName $this.firstName `
       -SurName $this.lastName `
       -userPrincipalName ($this.SamName + "@" + $GLOBAL:longDomain) `
       -Path $dPath.DistinguishedName `
       -Name ($this.lastName + "," + $this.firstName) `
       -Enabled $true `
       -AccountPassword(ConvertTo-SecureString $this.userPass -AsPlainText -force) `
       -ChangePasswordAtLogon $true

    #add user to be member of
    Add-ADGroupMember -Identity $this.userGroup -Members $this.SamName
  }
