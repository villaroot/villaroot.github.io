              An Object Oriented script to automate the tasks of Resetting Passwords, Enabling,
              and Disabling accounts in Active Directory. Prompts user to select which of the three
              action to perform. The script also allows parameters to be given, which will bypass the options and go perform
              the given actions. The Cmdlets used to perform these
              actions are Enable-ADAccount, Set-ADAccountPassword, and Disable-ADAccount.

            <h4 id="Details">Details:</h4>
            <p>
              We'll start with setting the parameters of 'action' and 'username'. ‘Action’ will be the variable
              used to hold the user’s choice, as they will be prompted for a decision to either enable, create or
              reset. Username will be the SamAccountName found in Active Directory. <br>

              'Import-Module ActiveDirectory' is required to perform actions to the Active Directory. The object
              'Employee' will be created later in the script, for now we’ll just declare it and hold it in a
              variable object of ‘userObj’. This will make it easier when we pass properties to the object.
              ‘Password’ will hold the password you want to set when it gets reseted. Later we will set it
              to where the user will be prompt to change thier password at first login. Next, we pass
              the password to the ‘Employee’ class through the variable we declared earlier of ‘userObj’<br>

             </p>
            <pre><code>
  #performs actions on an Active directory Acount
  #reset password,enable,disable
  [CmdletBinding()]Param (

        $action = $null,
        $userName = $null

    )

  Import-Module ActiveDirectory
  $userObj = [Employee]::New()
  $password = "TopSecret123!"
  $userObj.password = $password

            </code></pre>

            <p>
              If the values of ‘username’ and ‘action’ were not provided as parameters then we will
               ask the user for them. Example, the first 'if' statment says if '$username' is null '!'
               then perform the following command of 'enter the username'.
               Then pass the ‘username’ to the object we are using which will
               be used as the SamAccountName when we perform the Cmdlets.
            </p>
            <pre><code>
  #get username and pass to object
  if(!$username){
    $username = Read-Host "Enter the username"
  }

  #ask user which option to perform
  if(!$action){
    Write-host "Listing actions: `n`n1 - Reset `n2 - Enable `n3 - Disable`n"
    $action = Read-Host "Which action would you like to perform?"
  }

  $userObj.SamName = $username

            </code></pre>

            <p>
              The ‘action’ variable will now be passed through a switch statement to decide which commands to perform.
              Switches are very similar to if/else statements in that they are condition handlers. The important difference
              is switch statements process a higher number of conditions more efficiently than if/else.
              Even though only three choices are presented, This script can
              grow to perform other actions such as create,delete, provide general info, etc. To prepare for that, I
              chose a switch plus I personally think they look a lot cleaner. <br><br>
              The output presented at the start (such as ‘1 - Reset)’ will either get an input of ‘1’ or ‘reset’ from the user.
              In order to accept two values, I like to use the ‘-regex’ parameter. At a high level it’s
              pretty much like using a ‘-match’ option where it matches a variable to the switch options. It's like if regex is
              saying if 'x' or 'y' is in 'z' do these commands. In this case, if '1' or 'enable' is in '$action' <br><br>

              Try/Catch statements are great for handling errors. Basically it tries the commands in the try block, but
              if at any point it produces an error, it will immediately go to the ‘catch’ block and perform those given commands.
              When it goes to the ‘catch’ block you can output the error with ‘$_’ which in this case holds the current error. <br><br>
              We can now call the method to reset the password then output the user’s info with the
              Get-ADUser Cmdlet. Selecting only the related properties to be outputted. ‘fl’ formats the output in a
              list. We will go through the ‘ResetPassword’ method when we get to the Employee object.

            </p>
            <pre><code>
  #perform action that user chose
   switch -regex ($action){
     "(1|Reset)"{
       try {
         $userObj.ResetPassword()
         get-aduser $username -Properties passwordlastset,lockedout |
             select SamAccountName, Enabled, PasswordLastSet,Lockedout |fl
       }
       catch {
         Write-Host "`nFAILED: Password did NOT get reset. Outputting  error: "-ForegroundColor Red
         $_
        }
     break}

            </code></pre>

            <p>
              Continuing in the 'switch' decisions we provide the decisions for ‘2 Enable’ and
              ‘3 Disable’. Using ‘try/catch’ we try to perform the method call to perform the related
              commands, and output the related info with ‘Get-Aduser’. If any errors occur during this,
              it will go to the ‘catch’ block and perform those actions.  <br><br>
              ‘Default’ is called whenever none of the other switch options are used. It’s like the
              ‘else’ in if/else statements. Once all the switch ends, we clear the variables with ‘clear-variable’.
            </p>
            <pre><code>
  "(2|Enable)"{
    try {
      $userObj.EnableUser()
      Get-ADuser $username | Select SamAccountname, enabled
    }
    catch {
      Write-Host "`nFAILED: Account did not get enabled. Outputting  error: "-ForegroundColor Red
      $_
     }
    break}

  "(3|Disable)"{
    try {
      $userObj.DisableUser()
      Get-ADuser $username | Select SamAccountname, enabled
    }
    catch {
      Write-Host "`nFAILED: Account did not get disabled. Outputting  error: "-ForegroundColor Red
      $_
     }
    break}

    default{
      write-host "$action is an invalid option"
    }

  }

  #clear variables
  clear-variable -Name action,userName,password
            </code></pre>


              <p>
                Now we get to the ‘Employee’ object that was called at the beginning. First set the property names,
                followed by the methods. The methods that will be used will perform actions of
                resetting passwords, enabling and disabling accounts.
                ‘$this’ is just an easy way to refer to whichever object it’s inside. Ex. read
                ‘$this.SamName’ as ‘Employee.SamName’<br><br />

                The ‘RestPassword’ method is declared as a ‘void’ as we will not be returning anything.
                Outputs will be given to let the user know which step is being performed.
                Note: If at any point there are failures, it will stop and immediately go  to the ‘catch’
                block from the main script. <br><br />
                Set-ADAccountPassword will be used to set the password for the user that is declared with
                ‘Identity’.  The new password is set with ‘NewPassword’ and we will use ‘Reset’ so that
                we don’t have to provide the old password too. The password has to be given as a secure
                string which can be done with ‘ConvertTo-Secure-String’.<br><br>
                It’s recommended to force the user to change it once they log in. If not they can
                put it off and end up keeping that default password.
                To force them to change we will use the ‘Set-Aduser’ Cmdlet which allows modifications
                to already existing accounts. Here we modify the ‘ChangePasswordAtLogon’
                property to ‘$true’. <br><br>

                Whenever users input their passwords too many times they will probably get their
                accounts locked. So we’ll just unlock it to avoid that issue with ‘Unlock-ADAccount’
                then provide the username.

              </p>
              <pre><code>
  ############CLASS###########
   class Employee {
     [string]$SamName
     [string]$password

     [void]ResetPassword() {
       Write-Host "resetting password...`n"
       Set-ADAccountPassword -Identity $this.SamName -NewPassword `
           (ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText $this.password -Force) -Reset

       Write-Host "Account is also unlocked"
       Write-Host "SUCCESS: Password reset, and account unlocked. Outputting  info:"
     }


              </code></pre>
            <p>
              We end the object with the Enable and Disable methods. Pretty simple commands,
              so there's not much explanation needed. Enable-ADAccount enables the given account,
              and Disable-ADAccount disables the given account. <br><br>
              Just as bonus info, if you need to disable or enable everyone in an OU
              use a command such as:<br> Get-Aduser -filter ‘Name -like “*”’
              -SearchBase “OU=Finance,OU=Users, DC=villaroot,DC=com” | Disable-ADAccount <br>
              Essentially Get-Aduser grabs all the accounts provided in the given SearchBase,
              then it disables whatever it grabs with Disable-ADAccount. change to Enable-ADAccount
              if you want enable instead.
            </p>
            <pre><code>
    [void]EnableUser(){
      Write-Host "Enabling Account...`n"
