          <p>
            Highly recommend going through the OSCP certification, the amount of knowledge
            I gained throughout my studies was astounding. I signed up for the 90-day PWK
            Course in April and got my OSCP in November the same year on my third exam attempt.
            When I first signed up the PWK course I had very basic Penetration testing knowledge,
            I could barley do an easy box on Hack the Box and that’s only with hints. I do have
            about a year and half work experience managing/supporting Linux and Windows Servers.
            This did help me as I was very comfortable navigating around a server, and dealing
            with custom made scripts written in Bash, PowerShell, and Python. If you’re
            contemplating waiting or just going for it; I’d say if you have fundamental
            knowledge of Servers and Cyber Security then that’s good enough to start.
            You’ll learn what you need to as you go.

          <p>
            PWK PDF book - Once you sign up and pay the course fee, it takes about a week (at least
            it did for me) to get your ‘start’ date which is the date you officially start the PWK
            course and get the PDF book. I highly recommend going through the PDF and actually
            performing the exercises in the Lab environment. It’s easy to skim and not think it’s
            needed but going through the exercises will get you to actually learn each topic in
            detail. You get 5 extra points if you complete all the exercises, but I don’t think
            it’s worth it because there are A TON of exercises, and it will take too long.
            Instead, just spend a day on a chapter. If you can’t fully complete the exercises,
            at least you did enough to understand the topic deeper. For the first month I went
            through the PDF exclusively.
            <br><br>
            PWK Lab – Along with the PDF book, you also get access to the Lab environment,
            and the ‘student forum’. Where other students can help with hints on the Lab
            machines. I didn’t spend too much time here, there is a list of around 7-8 machines
            it says to start off with and will give hints on how to exploit them. I basically
            just did those machines which took about half a month.
            <br><br>
            Hacking Platforms –<br>
            Proving Grounds: On my Third Month I felt comfortable enough to start practicing on
            hacking platforms and went straight to Proving Grounds which is Offensive Security’s
            Hacking platform. It was highly recommended, and I will put my stamp on that
            recommendation as well. The machines have the same feel as the OSCP machines, and
            was the best preparation for the exams. Before my 1 Exam attempt I did about 30
            machines in the paid ‘Practice’ section, through the whole studying I did about
            50 machines. I used TJ_Null’s list as a guide to which ones to make sure to cover.
            <br><br>
             Try Hack Me: I basically only did the SQL Injection, LFI, and Buffer Overflow Prep
             rooms. The Buffer Overflow Prep room is the go-to study/practice material. The LFI
             and SQL injection rooms were good, and helped me practice on those topics more.
             There are plenty of rooms to practice and touch up on certain skills, so feel free
             to check others out as well.
            <br><br>
            Content Creators - <br>
            Tib3rius: His Priv Escalation courses on Udemy are very good, they are straight to the
            point and shows him running through each of his topics. The Buffer Overflow Prep room
            on Try Hack Me is the 'go to', to practice BOF and is a necessity. <br><br>
            The Cyber Mentor: His courses are very beginner friendly, and does a good job making
            topics easy to understand. I would recommend it being the starting point if you don’t
            want to purchase the PWK course just yet but want to get a better understand of what
            to expect when studying for the OSCP.<br><br>
            Alh4zr3d: I found his content towards the end of my journey, and I wish I found it sooner.
            His Buffer Overflow video is in my opinion the best at explaining what’s going on.
            I try to catch his twitch stream as often as I can. He has it during the evenings
            Tuesday, Thursday, and Sunday. Where Tuesday is his ‘noob Tuesday’ and goes through
            boxes while explaining as if everyone is a ‘noob’. Which is great because if you
            are unsure of why certain commands are ran, or about certain methodologies, this
            is the perfect time to ask.<br><br>
            John Hammond and Ippsec: Grouping together because I used their content in similar ways.
            They both post walkthroughs going through different boxes or Try Hack Me rooms. Which is very helpful as
            I can see how they deal with certain problems, and thier methodologies.When
            I’m not doing any hands on practicing, it’s nice to just watch a few videos and get some
            helpful information while being entertained. 
            <br><br>
            At the end of my 90-day Course period I scheduled my exam for a month out. The
            slots do fill up quick, so schedule as soon as you can. You are also able to
            reschedule up to 3 times in case something comes up preventing you from the
            taking the exam as long as you do so within 48 hours of the exam time. All
            three of my exams started at 5PM, as that time works best for me. Your screen
            will be proctored and no cell phones are allowed next to you. You are allowed
            to enter the proctored room up to 15 before the exam. It will be through a
            browser extension, and will require a webcam to be set up. <br>

          <h4 id="Exam 1">Exam 1 FAIL (55-points):</h4>
          <p>
            5PM – 10:00PM<br>
            I started my exam at 5PM, got my machines and for the first 30 minutes I was trying
            to set everything up including my nmap scans on the 4 non-BOF machines.<br> For nmap scans
            I use: sudo nmap -A -p- (ipaddress) |tee nmap-scan.out <br> Once I was set up, I
            started on the BOF (25-points) and went through my steps. It took a lot longer
            than I wanted, but I finally got my exploit script working around 9:30PM. I
            had got stuck and decided to go through the whole process again to see what
            was causing my script to not work. It ended up being I had written down my
            IP address wrong so my payload was being sent to the wrong IP address. I
            took about a 30-minute break afterwards.
            <br><br>
            10:00PM – 12:00PM<br>
            To get quick points I went to the easy box (10-points) and didn’t have to much
            trouble. I enumerated each port that appeared in my nmap scan. Eventually found
            the right exploit, and got the needed flag. Took about a 20-minute break afterwards.
            <br><br>
            12:00PM – 5:00AM<br>
            By Midnight I only had 35 points and was discouraged because I had planned to have
            55 points by the time I go to sleep. I still very focused, so I decided to keep
            going and started on one of the Intermediate (20-point) machines. I got an initial
            foothold around 3:00am, and took a quick break. I thought I was still feeling okay,
            and I’m very comfortable with Privilege Escalation so I wanted to keep going.
            I found the right path pretty quick, but was having issues getting it to work.
            Around 5:00AM I got the exploit working and was able to get the needed flag.
            <br><br>
            5:00AM – 10:00AM<br>
            Here I took a nap. Just kidding, here is where I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN A NAP; however,
            I was stubborn and had adrenaline and stayed up. In my head I was saying I just
            need one more box and I pass this exam that I was so excited to get. I felt my
            stubble with the BOF just through me off and I didn’t have much trouble with the
            two other boxes so far. I made the poor decision to keep going, I checkout the
            ports. Tried a few things that didn’t work, and tried some other things that
            didn’t work. Time flew so fast and by the time I knew it, it was around 10:00AM.
            Then I hit a wall, a sleep/exhausted wall.
            <br><br>
            10:00AM – 4:45PM<br>
            I was feeling the sleepiness hard, and could not focus on anything. I kept catching
            myself staring onto the same work for 10 minutes straight. I felt it was too
            late to take a nap, and pretty much made zero progress. Time was up and I
            ended the exam with 55-points.
            <br><br>
            I felt the biggest hit was my initial struggle with the BOF, it got me to a
            bad start and I should have finished it a lot sooner which would have let me
            get my goal of 55-points before I fell asleep. I scheduled my exam for a month
            away (the required cool down period). I got busy with work and didn’t really do
            much studying in between. Probably just 4-5 boxes on Proving Grounds during the whole month.
            <br><br>
          </p>

          <h4 id="Exam 2">Exam 2 FAIL (45-points):</h4>
          <p>
            5:00PM – 7:30PM<br>
            Started my nmap scans on the 4 non-BOF machine, then started working on BOF.
            Took about an hour and half – two hours to get BOF.<br>
            For nmap scans I use: sudo nmap -A -p- (ipaddress) |tee nmap-scan.out
            <br><br>
            7:30PM – 10:00PM<br>
            I went to the easy 10 pointer and was having issues running a python script.
            I was getting specific module failures and tried to resolve but wasn’t able to.
            During my studies I modify the environment and I believe I must have messed up
            the needed modules. I would try uninstalling and installing but couldn’t get it
            work. I don’t end up rooting this machine during my exam. I strongly believe I
            had the right path but couldn’t get the script working (weeks later I realize
            it was my VM and ended up restoring from old snapshot before my third exam).
            <br><br>
            10:00PM – 2:00AM<br>
            Without getting the easy box, I decided to switch to one of the intermediate
            (20-point) box. I was enumerating and thought I found some intriguing paths,
            but ended up not getting anything during this time.
            <br><br>
            2:00AM – 8:00AM<br>
            Remembering how sleepy I was during my first exam I had to take a nap on this
            attempt. Which I did, and woke up around 8AM.
            <br><br>
            8:00AM – 11:00AM<br>
            I switched to the other intermediate (20-point) box and started enumerating
            from the nmap scan results. I was able to get an initial shell in about two
            hours and root in about an hour.
            <br><br>
            11:00AM – 5:00PM<br>
            With 45 points, I would either need the hard or both easy and intermediate
            boxes to pass. The hard box looked pretty intimidating (you’ll know when you
            see the hard boxes). Since I had already enumerated/ worked on the easy and
            intermediate, I decided I already had progress on those and went that route.
            I spent most of the time on the intermediate and got really far in a path.
            I just couldn’t get an initial shell and didn’t get any points. For the easy,
            I still couldn’t get the python modules working and wasn’t able to get any
            points either. I ended up failing with 45-points.
            <br><br>
            I wanted the required 2 months to book my third exam (This was way too much
            time and the extra time didn’t help at all). During this time, I really
            didn’t do any OSCP studying except for maybe a week before the exam to
            take off some rust. Having taken the exam twice already, I pretty much
            knew the ‘feel’ of the exams. I reset my VM to an earlier snapshot because
            I was having python module issues on exam 2.
            <br><br>
          </p>

          <h4 id="Exam 3">Exam 3 PASS (90-points):</h4>
          <p>
            5:00PM – 6:30PM<br>
            Started my nmap scans as normal on the 4 non-BOF machines. Was able to
            get BOF in about an hour and took a break afterwards.<br>
            For nmap scans I use: sudo nmap -A -p- (ipaddress) |tee nmap-scan.out
            <br><br>
            6:30PM – 9:30PM<br>
            I moved to the easy (10-point) box and enumerated really good. I had a
            really good feeling on a certain path, but kept trying different ways
            and couldn’t get it working. I didn’t want to waste more time so I switched boxed.
            <br><br>
            9:30PM – 2:30AM<br>
            I switched to one of the intermediate (20-point) box and got an initial
            shell around 1:00AM. The privilege escalation wasn’t too difficult for me
            and I got the needed flags around 2:30AM.
            <br><br>
            2:30AM – 6:00AM<br>
            I took a break at 2:30AM to take a nap. I tried, but was not able to
            sleep. I decided to go back to the exam and try the other intermediate
            (20-point) box. I was able to get the initial foothold and escalate my privileges
            <br><br>
            6:00AM – 12:00PM<br>
            Took a much-needed nap, and felt so much better. This is where I should
            have taken a nap on my first Exam, but you live and learn.

            12:00PM – 1:00PM<br>
            I just need 5 points to pass, so I try to go back to the easy box and
            keep trying my exploit. After an hour I can’t get it work and start
            feeling nervous. I didn’t feel like I was getting anywhere so I decided
            to just leave it and go to the hard box.

            1:00PM-4:45PM<br>
            The hard box, was well… hard. It took about 3 difficult hours to get the
            initial foothold. The privilege escalation was a bit difficult to find,
            but I was able to get it working just in time. I got root/system access
            and the needed flags around 4:30PM. I ended the exam passing with an
            expected score of 90 points.

            The report wasn’t so much hard, as much as it was tedious. I took screenshots and
            notes throughout the exam. Once I finished the exam, I just organized the notes
            and screenshots to make it where someone can follow step by step. Make sure to
            have screenshots of the ipaddress, the user you are, and the output including the FULL
            path name to each flag.
            The report took about 4-5 hours to complete, but I took many breaks in
            between.
            The way that I formatted the ‘walkthrough’ sections for each box was I
            would be similar to below:
            <pre><code>
  *give brief sentence describing what I’m about to do*
  Run: Put command here
  *put screenshot of command running and output, highlight any key output*
             </code></pre>
            <br>
          </p>

              Going through the course is definitely worth it, I’ve learned so much
              and it’s a course where you actually have to perform and showcase what
              you’ve learned. If you can go through intermediate boxes on Proving Grounds
              without any hints or walkthroughs, in my opinion you will do good on the
              Exam. Take breaks often, and be careful for rabbit holes. When first
              enumerating a box, take up to 15 minutes per port. Once you go through
              the ports, take a step back and do triage. See which looks most
              interesting and dig deeper. When all else fails, enumerate more.
              <br><br>
              If you want to do a 'practice exam' I would recommend picking four boxes
              from TJ Nulls List - an easy, two intermediate, and one hard box. Then take
              a day and try to root all the boxes, and the BOF from Tib’s Try hack me room.
              Do this without any walkthroughs or hints and work through the struggling.
              Get as far as you can, and afterwards you can look at the walkthroughs.
              <br><br>
              Hopefully this writeup helps, and good luck on the OSCP I believe you can definitely pass it.
